# Software Engineering Notes

## Software Engineering

- The term "Software Engineering" is a product of Software and Engineering.
- Software is a collection of integrated programs.
- A Software consists of carefully organised instructions and code written by developers by using many or various programming languages, computer programs and related documentation.
- Engineering is the application of scientific and practical knowledge to invent, design, build, maintain, and improve frameworks, processes, etc.
- Software Engineering is an Engineering branch related to the evolution of software product using well defined scientific principles, techniques, and procedures.
- The result of Software Engineering is an Effective and Reliable software product.
- Software Engineering is a systematic collection of good program development practices and techniques.
- Software Engineering is an Engineering approach to develop software.
- Software Engineering discusses systematic and cost effective techniques for software development. These techniques help to develop software using an Engineering Approach.

## Importance of Software Engineering:

### Decrease Time

Anything that is not made according to the project always wastes time and if you are making great software, then you may need to run many codes to get the definitive running code. This is a very time consuming procedure and if it is not well handled, then this can take a lot of time. So if you are making your software according to the software engineering method, then it will decrease a lot of time.

### Reduce Complexity

Big Software is Always complicated and challenging to progress. Software Engineering has a great solution to reduce the complications of any project. Software Engineering divides Big Problems into Various Small issues and then start solving each small issue one by one. All these small problems are solved independently to each other.

### Minimise Software Model

### Handling Big Project

### Effectiveness

### Reliable Software

## Why is Software Engineering required?

- To manage Larger Software or Huge Programming. It is simpler to manufacture a wall than to a house or building. Similarly, as the measure of programming become extensive engineering has to step to give it a scientific process.
- For more scalability or adaptability. If the software procedure were not based on scientific and engineering ideas, it would be simpler to recreate new software than to scale an existing one.
- As the Hardware Industry has demonstrated its skills, and huge manufacturing has let down the cost of computer and electronic hardware, but the cost of programming remains high if the proper process is not adapted.

## Dynamic Nature of the Software

- Continually growing and adapting nature of Programming hugely depends upon the environment in which the client works. If the Quality of the Software is continually changing, new upgrades need to be done in the existing one.

## Quality Management

- Better procedure of software development provides a better quality of software.
